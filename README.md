  - My Vision is to create *Free & Paid Resources* for the Blender Community, which requires complex setups provided in a simplified, effective way. I  Have 7 Months of Experience with Blender, mainly focusing on making procedural stuff with Geometry Nodes which can also be edited procedurally and require minimum manual tweaks. 
  
  ### ðŸš€ Experience
  - I have been Investing time into 2D and 3D learning and developing skills at mid of COVID-19 Outbreak, and explored software like Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro for 2D Art Creations and Blender & Cinema 4D for 3D Artworks. Primarily Using **Blender** For 3D stuff and spending Approximately 2Hrs Everyday learning through Youtube Tutorials and From the Awesome Blender Community.
