  - Added Popover at Geometry Node Editor - Header, which contains:
     * [Changelogs](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/edit/Master/README.md#magic_wand-changelogs)
     * [Example Files](https://discord.gg/eKdswfAS)
     * [Report A Bug](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues)
  - Created [Tams 3d's Discord server](https://discord.gg/TNgzbZCdnY) to connect with the community for Support, Resources, including dev talks.

## :infinity: Github Repository Changes

  - Added `Experimental` Branch.
  - Added `Development` Branch.
  - Branches are allocated based on usability and developments.
    * [Master](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Master) - New Releases with major changes and added Support.
    * [Experimental](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Experimental) - Most Frequent Updates have the latest features, and while there might be bug fixes too, they are unstable.
    * [Development](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Development) - Contains Incomplete codes, To-do works and preview checks. (Not Intended For Public Use, Strictly Only for Developers).
   - Commits with completed changes will be moved from the `Development` Branch to the `Experimental` Branch after Verification.
   - `Experimental` Branch has upcoming developments which are expected to come in the `Master`

## :link: Updates & Restrictions

- Our Presets are made only to run on Latest Stable Blender Release as of date - Blender 3.3 & Above are supported.
- Due to the Introduction of [Named Attributes System](https://developer.blender.org/T91742), most Node-groups contain Named Attributes for faster computation and simplicity. Some nodes like "UV To Mesh" & "Sweep Curve" uses a Specific Attribute Domain, which is Interpolated by "Interpolate Domain", older versions of Blender will not be supported and will not get supported.
- Experimental Branch Content usages are at your own risk! IT MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT LOSS AND INCOMPATIBILITY!
- Older Addon versions Will be discontinued, and User Manually Need to Upgrade to New Versions
- Updates will frequently be provided as-soon-as-possible undoubtedly and for free!
- Tams 3d's GN Presets has been used as T3D Presets to preserve string length.

  - **Displacer** strength is based on-axis and normal; custom normals aren't supported yet
  - **Distribute Points in Volume** selection is 3D based, similar to Volume Cube Density.
  - **Easing** works only for fields between 0-1.
  - **Geometry Type:** ***Instance*** is not supported yet,  `Realise Instances` before using them.
  - **Geometry Type:** ***Volume*** is not supported yet
  - **UV To Mesh** only works with Uv-ed Meshes.

  - Hey! I am **Tamil Selvan** also known as **tams_3d**. I am a 15-Year-Old Self Taught Blender Artist from **India**.
  - My Vision is to create *Free & Paid Resources* for the Blender Community, which does complex task or requires complex setups in a simplified, effective way. I  Have 7 Months of Experience with Blender, mainly focusing on making procedural stuff with Geometry Nodes which can also be edited procedurally and require minimum manual tweaks. 
  
  ### ðŸš€ Experience
  - I have been Investing time into 2D and 3D learning and developing skills at mid of COVID-19 Outbreak, and explored software like Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro for 2D Art Creations and Blender and Cinema 4D for 3D Artworks. It has been eight months into 3D and Primarily Using **Blender** For 3D stuff and spending Approximately 2Hrs Everyday learning through Youtube Tutorials and From the Awesome Blender Community.
