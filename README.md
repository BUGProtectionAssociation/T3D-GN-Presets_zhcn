# Introduction:
* [T3D GN Presets](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/) are Custom made Node Groups for Geometry Nodes which include Primitive Geometries, Deformers, Fields, Generators, Utilities and much more for **free!** only for [Blender](https://www.blender.org). 
* This is an essential component of an artistâ€™s toolkit which enables users to combine multiple nodes with endless possibilities in non-destructive workflows with existing Blender tools.
* *T3D GN Presets* is a user-friendly addon that helps artists generate faster recursions of ideas by unlocking proceduralism.

# Release Notes:
- T3D-GN-Presets (v1.0.1) is currently in Alpha. Find older version release notes [here]().     
- [Hyperlinks]() are set to `Experimental` Branch contents. 
- [Corrective Release]() has been introduced for minor fixes.

# Core:
- Complete Restructuring of [ `_init_.py` ]() which packs more information to developers such as Licence, Previous updates and further improvements.
- Removed unfinished/ unreleased features.
- Maintained lowercase and relative paths 
- Replaced Popover with only Icon `<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106262964/191753865-f69ae775-f7cf-4075-8ac9-0d1861b9fef1.png"

## Performance
- Rewritten `Displacer` gains 5-10% speed and stability with a 1 Million vertex grid.
- Rewritten `UV To Mesh` is now 2-5% faster. 
- Rewritten `Align To Spline` to work with all types of splines
- Rewritten all Fields nodes to improve stability. Fixed inverted direction while transforming with empties.
- Removal of UV feature in `Sweep Curve` gains 85% increase. Supports non-cyclic curves
- Renamed & Rewritten `Reset Position` to `Center Elements` is 15% faster with Mesh, Curves, Points, Instances, Volume Combined
- Rewritten `Inset Faces` works without internal dependencies to reduce attribute storing computations  

## New Nodes & Categories :
### Nodes
- **Smooth Curve** - Curve to Bezier with smoothing
- **Prism Field** - Prism Falloff
- **Torus Field** - Torus Falloff
- **Modify Field** - Field Modifier with direct controls of the Input Field
- **Atom Array** - Generate Atom Array with Vertex and Edge Instances

### Category: SDF (Signed Distance Function)
#### Primitives:
- SDF Box
- SDF Cylinder
- SDF Ngon
- SDF Torus

#### Modifiers:
- SDF Boolean
- SDF Displacement

## New Features & Changes :
- Added *Tooltips*
- Added *Separators*
- Renamed Inputs and Outputs to make uniform across the category
- Added per Mesh island control and Selection to `Center Elements`
- Added Bound Center in `Center Elements` for faster computation
- Renamed `Manifold Edge Selection` to `Non-Manifold Edge Selection` with Non-Manifold Edge Selection Output
- Added Global strength with Axis Controls for `Displacer` Now Supports Geometry without Generic Normal Attribute
- Made _Center at Origin_ as default in Point and Curve Primitives
- Added Invert in `Transforms To Position and Vector Mapping` 
- Added and corrected Offset Output in `Center Elements` & `Rotate Elements`
- Added Support for *Geometry Type: Volume* in `Instancers`
- `Poke Faces` now outputs New Vertices Selection
- Fixed `Spherify` to maintain Face Area
- Corrected inverted scale in `Transforms to Position`

##  Breaking Changes:
- Removed UV from `Sweep Curve`
- Reset Position renamed to `Center Elements`
- Fields are made Scale-based instead of size-based

#### Corrective Releases:
- As of now, there are no updates regarding corrective Releases, bug reports will be viewed and resolved as soon as possible.
- Minor fixes will be directly committed from `Experimental` â†’ `Master` apart from [Release]()
- Substantial fixes will be released directly replacing the Main Release as Corrective Release.

# Development:
- Developments are happening on daily basis in [Experimental]() Branch regarding bug fixes, and support for every upcoming [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) release.
- Support for [Blender 3.4 Alpha]() is not yet started as of now. There will be a huge improvement in UI like *[Mix RGB]() , [Transfer Attribute]()*
- We will have discussions regarding the *Removal/ Renaming/ Restructuring* of nodes like `Distribute Points in Volume` , and  `Sweep Curve`.
- Plans for [Corrective Releases]()
- Plans for adding nodes as [Assets](https://developer.blender.org/rBbdb57541475f20)
- Devtalks are held on My [Discord Server]()

## :ghost: Bug Reports & Fixes
- Submit Bug reports and feature requests [here](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues).
- Review file changes [here](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/pulls).
- Fixes will be provided periodically as assured.

## Fixes

- [x] [Deformers](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues/5) to work properly with `Center Elements`
- [x] [Instancers](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues/6) support Geometry type: *Volume*
- [x] [UV To Mesh](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues/7) gets *Generate UV* option

## Access to Source Code:

- [ `_init_.py` ]() defines the addon followed by [geonode_groups.json]() which contains a list of categories with nodes.
- [geonode_nodes.blend]() contains all the Node-groups which are displayed under `T3D GN Presets`

  * You are free for any purpose.
  * You are free to distribute unless the license is modified.
  * You can distribute changed versions.
