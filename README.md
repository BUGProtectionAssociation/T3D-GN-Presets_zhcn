## :bulb: Introduction

- **T3D GN Presets** are designed to solve basic operations which require much more complex node trees and time-consuming processes with a simple, **easy-to-use solution**. We assure to provide constant updates, bug fixes, and Support for every newest Blender Stable Releases. 
- This Addon Will evolve many new changes over time with performance, customizability, and user requests as the main key. 
- **T3D GN Presets** Add-on is located at `Geometry Node Editor > Add > T3D Presets` - with separate categories based on uses. Requested Users to read [Licence & Files](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/README.md#licencing--files) before sharing files and intend to modify. 
- The Addon Stability & Releases are being defined by the [Changelogs](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/README.md#magic_wand-changelogs--release-notes) Version.

## :magic_wand: Changelogs & Release Notes

  ### Current Release: Version 1.0.0 :large_blue_circle:

  - **T3D GN Presets** is a Fully Functional Addon with menus and submenus.
  - Added Popover at Geometry Node Editor - Header, which contains:
     * [Changelogs](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/README.md#magic_wand-changelogs--release-notes)
     * [Example Files](https://discord.gg/eKdswfAS)
     * [Report A Bug](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues)
  - Created [Tams 3d's Discord server](https://discord.gg/TNgzbZCdnY) to connect with the community for Support, Resources, including dev talks.

## :infinity: Github Repository Changes

  - Branches are allocated based on usability and developments.
    * [Master](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Master) - New Releases with major changes and added Support.
    * [Experimental](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Experimental) - Contains the latest features, and while there might be cool bug fixes too, they are unstable and can mess up your files.

## :link: Updates & Restrictions

- Our Presets are made only to run on Latest Stable Blender Release as of date - Blender 3.3 LTS & Above are supported.
- Due to the Introduction of [Named Attributes System](https://developer.blender.org/T91742), most Node-groups contain Named Attributes for faster computation and simplicity. Some nodes like "UV To Mesh" & "Sweep Curve" uses a Specific Attribute Domain, which is Interpolated by [Interpolate Domain](https://developer.blender.org/D15289); older versions of Blender will not be supported and will not get supported.
- Experimental Branch Content usages are at your own risk! IT MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT LOSS AND INCOMPATIBILITY!
- Older Addon versions will be discontinued, and User Manually Need to Upgrade to New Versions.
- Updates will frequently be provided as-soon-as-possible, undoubtedly and for free!
- `Tams 3d's GN Presets` have been used as `T3D Presets` to preserve string length.

  - Hey! I am **Tamil Selvan**, also known as **tams_3d**. I am a 15-Year-Old Self Taught Blender Artist from **India**.
  - My Vision is to create *Free & Paid Resources* for the Blender Community, which requires complex setups in a simplified, effective way. I  Have 7 Months of Experience with Blender, mainly focusing on making procedural stuff with Geometry Nodes which can also be edited procedurally and require minimum manual tweaks. 
  
  ### ðŸš€ Experience
  - I have been Investing time into 2D and 3D learning and developing skills at mid of COVID-19 Outbreak, and explored software like Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro for 2D Art Creations and Blender and Cinema 4D for 3D Artworks. It has been eight months into 3D, and Primarily Using **Blender** For 3D stuff and spending Approximately 2Hrs Everyday learning through Youtube Tutorials and From the Awesome Blender Community.
