# üí° Introduction

- *T3D GN Presets* are designed to solve basic operations which require complex node tree setups with **easy-to-use solution**. 
- Constant updates, bug fixes, and support provided as-soon-as-possible, undoubtedly and for **free!**
- This addon will evolve many new changes over time with performance, customizability, and user requests as the primary key. 
- **T3D GN Presets** Add-on is located at `Geometry Node Editor > Add > T3D Presets` - with separate categories based on uses.
- Requested Users to read [License & Files](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets#licencing--files) before sharing files and intend to modify. 

# ‚úÖ Corrective Release:
- **T3D-GN-Presets (v1.0.1)** is a Corrective Release. First released on 02.09.2022
-  This corrective release brings some removals which may break certain projects and standardization for future updates.
- [Corrective Release](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Master#-corrective-releases) has been introduced for minor fixes especially for [LTS](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/releases/tag/LTS)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Core:
- Execute code when it runs as script, prevents running as imported module.
- Added support for disabled buttons for Separation and Visual Improvement. **`^ `** as prefix makes disabled button
- Tooltips are now more specific on functions 
- `Deformers` which work in all type of geometry are now converted as **Assets**
- Added [Icons]() for `Deformers` which now supports **Asset Browser**

## Nodes
- `Coordinates` has been moved to `Vector` (Category)
- Fixed `Cartesian to Cylindrical`  **(r, Œ∏, z)**
- Added `Deformers` to **Assets** now supports Drag & Drop with Asset Browser for appended nodes.

## ü™Ö Performance:
- `UV To Mesh` to calculate UV at initial position avoids flicker and more stable and 1.5x faster because of [Spilt Edges mesh operator and multi-threading](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e83f46ea7630)
- `Geometry To Spline` doesn't remap index, removal of *Trim* 
- *Boolean inputs* to be made constant to avoid field computation in `Align To Spline` `Set Geometry Visibility` `Lathe Curve`

# üéâ New Nodes, Features & Changes:
## New Nodes:
- **Extend Curve** - Extrudes the endpoints of the curve along *Curve Tangent*
- **Vertex Slide** - Move vertices based on index
- **Rename Named Attribute** - Rename Stored Named Attribute (only Float & Vector are supported)

### Input:
- **Component Selection** - Select Individual Components
- **Edge Path Selection** - Select shortest edge path"
- **Select Similar Vertices** - Select Similar Vertices by property type
- **Select Similar Edges** - Select Similar Edges by property type
- **Select Similar Faces** - Select Similar Faces by property type
- **Select Index Range** - Select Index ranging from min & max value

### UV:
- Flip UV - Flips U & V of  UV Map
- UV Displace - Displace UV using vector
- UV Project - Generate UV Map based on Axis

## üéÜ New Features & Changes:

- Added *Disabled Buttons* as inter-category Separators
- Added Per Axis Strength as default `Displacer`
- Added *Position* input for **SDF**
- **Deformers** now support *Instances* as realized geometry.
- `Phyllotaxis` now outputs **Normal** of the points from Mesh

## :infinity: Github Repository Changes

  - Branches are allocated based on usability and developments.
    * [Master](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Master) - New Releases with major changes and added Support.
    * [Experimental](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Experimental) - Contains the latest features, and while there might be cool bug fixes too, they are unstable and can mess up your files.

## :link: Updates & Restrictions

- Our Presets are made only to run on Latest Stable Blender Release as of date - **Blender 3.3 LTS & Above**
- Due to the Introduction of [Named Attributes System](https://developer.blender.org/T91742) - nodes contains some **Internal Dependencies** which may conflict with existing attributes.
- [Experimental Branch](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Experimental) Content usages **MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT LOSS AND INCOMPATIBILITY!**
- Older versions will be discontinued, and User Need to Upgrade to [New Version](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/releases).
- `Tams 3d's GN Presets` have been used as `T3D Presets` to preserve string length.

## :open_file_folder: Files & Source Code
  
  - [init.py]() has the Python code for the Addon, which contains some adaptations from other scripts with the same [Licence](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/LICENSE).
  - The [geonode_nodes.blend](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/geonode_nodes.blend) contains All the Node-groups as Fake-User which is being appended by the Addon; changes may bring errors.
  - The [geonode_nodes.json](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/geonode_nodes.json) contains the actual work of the menus and submenus with names of the Node-groups.

  - Fixes will be provided periodically.
  
  ## :mag: Known Issues
  - **Deformers** work differently when Geometry is Transformed before it; requested to use `Reset Position` before them.
  - **Displacer** strength is based on-axis and normal; custom normals aren't supported yet.
  - **Distribute Points in Volume** selection is 3D based, similar to Volume Cube Density.
  - **Easing** works only for fields between 0-1.
  - **Geometry Type:** ***Instance*** is not supported yet,  `Realise Instances` before using them.
  - **Geometry Type:** ***Volume*** is not supported yet.
  - **UV To Mesh** only works with Uv-ed Meshes.
  
 # :unicorn: About 
  - Hey! I am **Tamil Selvan**, also known as **tams_3d**. I am a 15-Year-Old Self Taught Blender Artist from **India**.
  - My Vision is to create *Free & Paid Resources* for the Blender Community, which requires complex setups provided in a simplified, effective way. I  Have 7 Months of Experience with Blender, mainly focusing on making procedural stuff with Geometry Nodes which can also be edited procedurally and require minimum manual tweaks. 
  
  ### üöÄ Experience
  - I have been Investing time into 2D and 3D learning and developing skills at mid of COVID-19 Outbreak, and explored software like Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro for 2D Art Creations and Blender & Cinema 4D for 3D Artwork. Primarily Using **Blender** For 3D stuff and spending Approximately 2Hrs every day learning through Youtube Tutorials and From the Awesome Blender Community.
