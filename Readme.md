# üí° Introduction:
* [T3D GN Presets](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/) are Custom made Node Groups for Geometry Nodes which include Deformers, Fields, SDF, UV , Utilities and much more for **free!**
* This is an essential component of an artist‚Äôs toolkit which enables users to combine multiple nodes with endless possibilities in non-destructive workflows with existing Blender tools.

# ü™Ñ Release Notes:
- **T3D-GN-Presets (v1.2.0)** is currenly in **Beta üü°**
- Download older versions for Blender 3.4 & below [here](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/releases).     
- [Corrective Release](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/tree/Master#-corrective-releases) has been introduced for minor fixes especially for [LTS](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/releases/tag/LTS)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Core:
## Source Files
- Execute code when it runs as script, prevents running as imported module.
- Added support for disabled buttons for Seperation and Visual Improvement. **`^ `** as prefix makes disabled button
- Tooltips are now more specific on functions 
- `Deformers` which work in all type of geometry are now converted as **Assets**
- Added [Icons]() for `Deformers` which now supports **Asset Browser**

## Nodes
- Replaced appropriate **[Mix node](https://archive.blender.org/developer/D13749)** for Data Types: float, vector & color
- Files saved with the new node are not compatible with older versions of Blender. Files saved with older version of addon are still compatible.
- `Coordinates` has been moved to `Vector` (Catergory)
- Renamed **Smooth >>> Smooth Mesh** to differentiate **Smooth Curve** & **Smooth Mesh**
- Fixed `Carterian to Cylindrical`  **(r, Œ∏, z)**
- **Clamp Type** has been set to _Range_ for nodes other than **Fields**
- Added `Deformers` to **Assets** now supports Drag & Drop with Asset Browswer for appended nodes.

## ü™Ö Performance:
- `UV To Mesh` to calculate UV at initial position avoilds flicker and more stable and 1.5x faster because of [Spilt Edges mesh operator and multi-threading](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/e83f46ea7630)
- `Geometry To Spline` doesnot remap index, removal of *Trim* 
- *Boolean inputs* to be made constant to avoid field computation in `Align To Spline` `Set Geometry Visibility` `Lathe Curve`
- `Smooth Mesh` to work with [Blur Attribute](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/d68c47ff347bbb3824)

# üéâ New Nodes, Features & Changes:
## New Nodes:
- **Extend Curve** - Extrudes the endpoints of the curve along *Curve Tangent*
- **Vertex Slide** - Move vertices based on index
- **Rename Named Attribute** - Rename Stored Named Attribute (only Float & Vector are supported)

## üíá Hair Curves:
This contains new Hair Curves supportd nodes and some modified nodes from bundled assets of ["Essentials"](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/104474)

- **Clump Hair Curves** 
- **Grow/Shrink Hair Curves**
- **Guide Curves**
- **Rotate Hair Curves**
- **Set Hair Curve Length**
- **Set Hair Curve Radius**
- **Straighten Hair Curves**

### Input:
- **Component Selection** - Select Individual Components
- **Edge Path Selection** - Select shortest edge path"
- **Select Similar Vertices** - Select Similar Vertices by property type
- **Select Similar Edges** - Select Similar Edges by property type
- **Select Similar Faces** - Select Similar Faces by property type
- **Select Index Range** - Select Index ranging from min & max value

### UV:
- UV Deform - Sets sampled position based on UV from Sample Mesh on Deform Mesh
- Flip UV - Flips U & V of  UV Map
- UV Displace - Displace UV using vector
- UV Project - Generate UV Map based on Axis

## üéÜ New Features & Changes:

- Added *Disabled Buttons* as inter-catergory Seperators
- Added Per Axis Strength as default `Displacer`
- Added *Position* input for **SDF**
- **Deformers** now support *Instances* as realised geometry.
- `Phyllotaxis` now outputs **Normal** of the points from Mesh

### Changes & Fixes
- *Field Inputs* are now hidden by default
- `Mesh To SDF` `Mesh To Field` are now evaluated using Raycast method.
- **Field** are now fully intergrated to work with transformations of objects.

# üéØ Development
- Developments are happening locally in regular basis regarding bug fixes, and support for every upcoming [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) releases.
- Support for [Blender 3.6 LTS ](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/milestone/5) is not yet started as of now. [Simulation Nodes](https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/geometry-nodes-simulation/)  will get eventually supported. 
- Dev conversations may start in future on My [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TNgzbZCdnY)
- Closed [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Tams3d/projects/2/views/1) for maintainance reasons.
- Closed & Removed *Experimental Branch*

#### ‚úÖ Corrective Releases:
- As of now, there are no major issues or bugs reported
- Minor fixes will be directly committed to `Master` and substancial fixes will be released as **Corrective Release** with updated informations

## ‚ôæÔ∏è GitHub Repository Changes

## üëª Bug Reports & Fixes
- Submit Bug reports and feature requests [here](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/issues)

# Licencing & Files:
## üìÑ Licence
- The Node groups, including the Addon, are licensed as [GNU GPL](https://github.com/Tams3d/T3D-GN-Presets/blob/Master/LICENSE) - the same license as Blender uses
